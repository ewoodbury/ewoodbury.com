I work on Tesla's Cell Manufacturing team, where I lead a team that builds software to enable more efficient manufacturing operations. My team runs the data platform reponsible for [factory reporting](https://x.com/Tesla/status/1798472011678966221) and [financial tracking](https://electrek.co/2024/04/24/tesla-expects-4680-battery-cells-cheaper-than-suppliers-end-of-year/).

I hope that my current work will pull forward the day when the world has access to cheap, abundant energy storage. 

My technical interests include analytical data systems (particularly Spark and data lakes), data validation and verifiability, and data visualization. I enjoy thinking about how data tools can be effective in large organizations.

I previously studied Chemical Engineering at UC Berkeley. I did a bit of research high-capacity, nickel-rich battery cathodes at Berkeley Lab and Tesla.

Outside of work, I'm interested in global development, particularly how to lift out of poverty the [650 million people living on less than $2.15 per day](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY). I'm also broadly interested in the [AI Alignment](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rJRw78oihoT5paFGd/high-level-hopes-for-ai-alignment).

Away from the keyboard, I enjoy cycling, running, hiking/backpacking, piano, and photography.
