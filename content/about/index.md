I work on Tesla's Cell Manufacturing team, where I lead a team that builds software to enable more efficient manufacturing operations. I hope that my work will pull forward the day when the world has access to cheap, abundant energy storage. 

I previously studied Chemical Engineering at UC Berkeley. I live in the Bay Area, where I was also born and raised.

My technical interests include databases, backend systems, and data visualization. I enjoy thinking about how data tools can enable organizations to function more optimally.

I'm also interested in global development, particularly how to most effectively lift out of poverty the [650 million people living on less than $2.15 per day](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY).
