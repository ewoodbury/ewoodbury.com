# Some Post Ideas

## ClickHouse

- Deep dive into joins
- Strategies for safe, atomic updates for aggregate data
- Danger of DDLs and cluster mode
- The Insane, Raw Scalability of ClickHouse
- ClickHouse as a fast cache for data apps
- How to mutate partition columns with ClickHouse (CREATE/ALTER/RENAME)

## Spark

- Unstable sort causing non-deterministic results when df lineage is evaluated multiple times
- My Spark testing setup
- Spark Streaming vs. Spark Structured Streaming
- Stop with chained `withColumn` calls!
- Strongly-typed DataSets with Scala Spark

## Scala

- WartRemover
- Functional programming in real applications

## Projects

- A purely functional Topological Sort in Scala 3
- Exploring cats-effect
- Exploring cats-actors (very small, 3rd party project)
- Benchmarking cats-actors vs Akka/Pekko

## Data Engineering

- You should write your Spark code with Scala
- Towards type-safety in data engineering

## AI
- Mental models for a codebase with AI
- Testing is the bottleneck for AI-assisted programming
- Compiled languages vs interpreted languages for AI-assisted programming

## Software Design
- Functional core, side effects only at the edges


## Testing Philosophy
- Parallelizing the spark-testing-base library
- Property-based testing to achieve correctness in Spark jobs
